abstract={Dragonfly algorithm (DA) is a novel swarm intelligence meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the dynamic and static swarming behaviors of artificial dragonflies in nature. It has proved its effectiveness and superiority compared to several well-known meta-heuristics available in the literature. This paper presents a comprehensive review of DA and its new variants classified into modified and hybrid versions. It also describes the main diverse applications of DA in several fields and areas such as machine learning, neural network, image processing, robotics, and engineering. Finally, the paper suggests some possible interesting research on the applications and hybridizations of DA for future works.},
